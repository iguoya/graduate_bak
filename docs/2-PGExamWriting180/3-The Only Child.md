# The Only Child



In the picture, three generations are featured. A young couple in the bottom, supporting their parents in the middle, their kid, a little girl, is on the top, supported by her four grandparents. This picture draws readers' attention to the pressure that China's one-child generation is facing. Pressures on them to provide for their parents and take care of their child are daunting.

**While I empathize with the couple in the picture, I still think that China's one-child policy should be continued in the foreseeable future.**

To begin with. **the one-child policy would continue to be good for China's economic development, which will contribute to better nutrition, rising levels of education, higher living standards, and longer life expectanceies for people.**

Moreover, the policy has been able to maintain a balance between population and resources. If the policy is discontinued, the population boom would drain the already limited resources, such as land, energy and other raw materials.

**In the light of the two reasons mentioned above, I think the one-child policy should be carried on for sake of our well-being.**
